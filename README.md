# List of app development tools

Our favourite tools for rapidly building web, desktop and mobile apps


### App development frameworks

- [meteor](meteor.com) - build front and backend in JS, deploy to web, OSX, Win, Linux and mobile in a few commands. Extremely powerful.
  - [atmosphere](http://atmospherejs.com) - find packages for meteor (e.g., search for any of the packages below to find how to add them to your meteor project)

### JS utility frameworks

- [lodash](https://lodash.com/) - lots of functional utilities - include this in every project. Saves a lot of time and code.
- [d3.js](http://d3js.org/) - map data to elements in the DOM. First choice for data visualisation.

### Design frameworks

- [materialize](http://materializecss.com/) - Google's Material Design as a comprehensive CSS framework. Beautiful out of the box.
  - [material design icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/) - community-improved version of the official Material Design icon font. Hundreds more icons!

### Colour scheme help

- [pltts.me](http://pltts.me) just a library of beautiful, modern colour schemes
- [colorhexa](http://www.colorhexa.com/) go deep into a colour to learn about what it works with

### Single-purpose tools

#### Time and date handling

- [moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) - the only datetime library you need.

#### Guided tours

We've included three options here, because they cater for different levels of complexity.

- [chardin.js](http://heelhook.github.io/chardin.js/) - simplest option: toggle an overlay that explains the elements on the page.
- [shepherd](http://github.hubspot.com/shepherd/docs/welcome/) - step-by-step, show an explanation for each element at a time.
- [tourist](http://easelinc.github.io/tourist/) - allows more complex interactions, e.g. perform some specific action before continuing. Good for tutorials.

#### Hotkeys

- [mousetrap](https://github.com/ccampbell/mousetrap) - small, simple and fairly feature-complete.

### Drag-and-drop

- [dragula](http://bevacqua.github.io/dragula/) is the only show in town. Seriously slick library to add draggability to your divs.
